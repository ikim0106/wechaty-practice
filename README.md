# Wechaty-practice

Wechaty practice in preparation for Candobot (maybe?)

## Functions ##
- automatic helpful reply if the message contains the word "help" 
- typing 'get (keyword)' will trigger a reply according to the keyword
- typing 'imgsearch (keyword)' will trigger a reply with a link according to the keyword, planning on adding top 5 images instead of just one

## Setting it up ##
- download the repository somewhere
- in the downloaded directory (using a command prompt) use ```npm install wechaty``` and you should be ready to go with ```node bot.js```
